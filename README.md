This is intended as a personal project with the primary goal of developing a videogame characterized by a gameplay rich in emergent behaviours.

A secondary goal is to offer an open sandbox for the development of machine learning models and playing agents that will be eventually included as part of the main game or as mods.

The primary driver of the development is the research of an aestethic ideal for the code in its simplicity and in the features of the game in their emerging impenetrable complexity. This is meant to be a game for the way you interact with it but it's not necessary an experience geared towards fun.

This game is loosely inspired to some masterpieces in their respective genres: Dwarf Fortress, Victoria II, NEO: Scavenger, Mount & Blade.
